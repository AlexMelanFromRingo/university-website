The project slightly modifies the BIP32Utils.py library to work with my code. The adaptations are aimed at using the SHA3-256 and SHA3-512 function instead of the standard SHA2-256 and SHA2-512. Also changed some variables that are specific to generating Bitcoin wallet addresses.

In general, the project is a library for generating hierarchical-deterministic wallets according to the BIP32, BIP39, BIP44 standards.
